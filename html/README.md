# Getting started with HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is NOT a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. [1]

## Objectives
To understand HTML tags and how browsers interprete each tag. Also to grasp the anatomy of a standard HTML page.

## Task
1. Update your repository by doing a git pull to download any changes.
2. Write a bash script that will create a directory, `www` with two files: `page1.html`, `page2.html` 
3. Create a simple 2 page book using the tables tag. Each page should contain a at least two images. One image should be used as a page header while the other image(s) should be place somewhere inside the paragraphs of text and aligned to the right or left of the page with the text wrapping around it. Below the page, there should be a page number linking to the next page or previous page. So page 1 should link to page 2 and page 2 should link back to page 1.
4. Link the "page 1" and "page 2" text in the `index.html` to you book pages.

The page text should contain atleast five paragraphs. Text and images can be generated using the sources below.
